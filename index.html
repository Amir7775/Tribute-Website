          <h1>Father Of The Nation</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</b> (17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975)
            popularly known by the honorific prefix Bangabandhu[d] (lit. 'Friend
            of Bengal') was a Bangladeshi politician, revolutionary, statesman,
            activist and diarist. As a politician, Mujib had held continuous
            positions as president or prime minister from April 1971 until his
            assassination in August 1975: as president from 1971 to 1972 and
            briefly from 1975 until his death, and as prime minister from 1972
            to 1975.[5][6] Mujib successfully led the Bangladeshi independence
            movement and restored the Bengali sovereignty after over two
            centuries following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, for which he is
            honoured as the 'Father of the Nation' in Bangladesh.[7] In 2011,
            the fifteenth constitutional amendment in Bangladesh referred to
            Sheikh Mujib as the Father of the Nation who declared independence;
            these references were enshrined in the fifth, sixth, and seventh
            schedules of the constitution.[8] His Bengali nationalist ideology,
            socio-political theories, and political doctrines are sometimes
            called Mujibism. Mujib emerged as a student activist in the province
            of Bengal during the final years of the British Raj. He was a member
            of the All India Muslim League. In 1949, Mujib was part of a
            liberal, secular and leftwing faction which later became the Awami
            League. In the 1950s, Mujib was elected to Pakistan's parliament
            where he defended the rights of East Bengal; wore suits and bowties;
            and was described as urbane and charming. By the 1960s, Mujib was
            transformed into the nationalist leader of East Pakistan, with his
            trademark Mujib coat and forceful oratory. He became popular for
            opposing political, ethnic and institutional discrimination; leading
            the 6-point autonomy movement; and challenging the regime of Field
            Marshal Ayub Khan. In 1970, Mujib led the Awami League to win
            Pakistan's first general election. When the military junta refused
            to transfer power, he gave the 7th March speech and announced an
            independence movement. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971,
            Mujib declared Bangladesh's independence. Bengali nationalists
            declared Mujib as the head of the provisional Bangladeshi government
            while he was confined in a jail in West Pakistan. He returned to
            Bangladesh in January 1972 as a hero. A populist of the 20th
            century, Sheikh Mujib was one of the most charismatic leaders of the
            Third World in the early 1970s. Mujib succeeded in normalizing
            diplomatic ties with most of the world, with a policy of friendship
            to all and malice to none. He signed a friendship treaty with India,
            joined the Commonwealth, NAM and the OIC, opposed apartheid and
            dispatched an army medical unit during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.
            Mujib's legacies include the secularist Constitution of Bangladesh
            and the transformation of East Pakistan's state apparatus,
            bureaucracy, armed forces, and judiciary into an independent
            Bangladeshi state. He gave the first Bengali speech to the UN
            General Assembly in 1974. Mujib's five-year regime was also the only
            socialist period in Bangladesh's history. In 1975, Mujib installed a
            one party state which lasted for seven months until his
            assassination. Mujib's legacy remains divisive among Bangladeshis
            due to his economic mismanagement, the Bangladesh famine of 1974,
            human rights violations, and authoritarianism. The Awami League has
            been accused of promoting a personality cult around Mujib. But most
            Bangladeshis credit Mujib for leading the country to independence in
            1971. In a 2004 BBC opinion poll, Mujib was voted as the Greatest
            Bengali of all time and ranked first on the list followed by Asia's
            first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (2nd) and Bangladeshi
            national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam (3rd).[9] Mujib's 7 March speech in
            1971 is recognized by UNESCO for its historic value, and enshrined
            in the Memory of the World Register – Asia and the Pacific.[10] His
            diaries and travelogues were published many years after his death
            and have been translated into several languages.
